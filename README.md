# 🌐 Offline Language Translator

An offline tool that translates text between multiple languages using Hugging Face’s `m2m100` model — no internet needed.

---

##  What This Project Does

- Translates text from one language to another  
- Works completely offline (great for secure or remote environments)  
- Supports many languages using pre-trained AI models

##  Why This Project?

I'm currently building this tool during my **internship at DRDO**, where internet-free tools are essential. The idea is to help users translate languages **without relying on cloud services** like Google Translate.
