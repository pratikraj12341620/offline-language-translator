# 💼 Pratik Raj – Internship Portfolio

Welcome to my internship project repository! This includes work on two major domains:

1. **Phase 1 – Cryptography and Secure Communication**
2. **Phase 2 – Offline Language Translation using AI**

---

## 🔐 Phase 1: Cryptography and Secure Communication

In this phase, I explored the foundations and practical applications of cryptography in modern digital communication. This includes understanding the workings of SSL/TLS protocols, encryption algorithms, and hashing techniques.

### 🚢 Learning Path Overview

```
1. Introduction to Cryptography
2. SSL/TLS Protocol Structure
3. TLS Handshake Mechanism
4. Types of Encryption:
   a. Symmetric Encryption (AES, DES)
   b. Asymmetric Encryption (RSA, Diffie-Hellman)
5. Public/Private Key Cryptography
6. Hashing Algorithms (SHA Family)
7. Digital Signatures
8. Application in Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
```

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

* **Cryptography Basics** – How plaintext is encrypted and decrypted.
* **SSL/TLS Protocols** – Encrypting web communication.
* **TLS Handshake** – Key exchange, authentication, and session setup.
* **Symmetric Encryption** – Explored AES and DES in detail.
* **Asymmetric Encryption** – Learned about RSA and Diffie-Hellman.
* **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** – Certificates and trust hierarchy.
* **Hashing Functions** – SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3 families.
* **Digital Signatures** – Ensures message integrity and authenticity.
* **Blockchain** – Basics of decentralized security and real-world application.

### 🛠 Tools & Skills Utilized

* **Languages:** Python, C, Java

## 🌐 Phase 2: Offline Language Translator

The objective of this project is to build a multilingual offline translation tool using pre-trained models. This tool will enable users to translate between languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Burmese, and English without internet connectivity.

### ✅ Project Exploration

* **Explored Pretrained Models:**

  * `m2m100` and `m2m100_1.2B` – Facebook's multilingual models capable of translating between 100+ languages **without relying on English as an intermediate**.
  * Studied `Argos Translate` and `LibreTranslate` – Online models providing translation APIs (used for reference only).
  * Reviewed `ymoslem/DesktopTranslator` – An open-source offline desktop translator application for real-world implementation insight.

* **Studied Key Concepts:**

  * Architecture of multilingual translation models.
  * Hugging Face Transformers and Tokenizers.
  * Tokenization, model inference, and decoding translated outputs.
  * Differences between online vs. offline translation tools.

### 🧠 Project Flow

```
Input Sentence → Tokenize → Pass to M2M100 → Decode → Output Translation
```

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Hugging Face Transformers & Tokenizers
* PyTorch
* Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

### 🔍 Current Status

* [x] Project goal and tools finalized
* [x] Researched available models and evaluated offline usage
* [x] Environment setup completed
* [ ] Model loading and basic input/output integration
* [ ] GUI creation (optional)
* [ ] Testing and optimization
