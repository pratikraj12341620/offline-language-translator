# 🌐 Offline Language Translator

An offline tool that translates text between multiple languages using Hugging Face’s `m2m100` model — no internet needed.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

- Translates text from one language to another  
- Works completely offline (great for secure or remote environments)  
- Supports many languages using pre-trained AI models
